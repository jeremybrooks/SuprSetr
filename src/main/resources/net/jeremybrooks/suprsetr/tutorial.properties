# This special property defines the name of the tutorial pages. For the default locale, it is "screen"
# For other locales, it should be "screen_xxx", where xxx is the language locale code.
# SuprSetr combines this property with other data to determine which html file to load for each page of the tutorial.
# For this to work, the html files must also be translated and present.
