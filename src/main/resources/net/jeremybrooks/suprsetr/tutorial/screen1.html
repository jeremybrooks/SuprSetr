<h1>Welcome to SuprSetr!</h1>

<p>
    This tutorial will show you how SuprSetr works and introduce you to the advanced
    tools available to manage your albums on Flickr.
</p>
<p>
    The first time you run SuprSetr, you will need to allow it to access your Flickr
    account. When you see the login dialog box, just click the Authorize
    button and your browser will open to a page on Flickr that will allow you
    to grant access to SuprSetr. Once you have authorized SuprSetr, you can
    close the browser window and return to SuprSetr.
</p>

<p>
    SuprSetr will then connect to Flickr and retrieve a list of your existing
    albums. At first, these albums will be unmanaged. This means that SuprSetr
    does not know anything about the parameters that define the content of the album,
    and so will not attempt to refresh the albums.
