        <h1>Managing Your Albums</h1>
        <p>
            To allow SuprSetr to manage one of your albums, double click the album
            and you will be taken to the Album Editor window. Once you check the
            box that says
            "Manage this album with SuprSetr", you can define the parameters of
            the album. Parameters include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tags</li>
            <li>Machine Tags</li>
            <li>Date Taken</li>
            <li>Date Uploaded</li>
            <li>Sorting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once you define the parameters of the album, SuprSetr will know how to
            search your Flickr stream for photos that match the parameters, and
            can then update the content of the album based on the search
            results. SuprSetr will add and remove photos from the album to make
            it match the results of the search. However, SuprSetr will NEVER
            delete photos from your photostream.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Twitter</h1>
        <p>If you authorize SuprSetr to use your Twitter account, you can choose
            to send a tweet each time new photos are added to your albums. You can
            enable and disable tweets for each album, and you can customize
            the message per album. When customizing the message, you can specify
            some tokens that will be filled in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>%t - This will be replaced with the album title</li>
            <li>%u - This will be replaced with the album URL. The URL will be shortened with bit.ly</li>
            <li>%c - This will be replaced with the number of photos that were added to the album</li>
            <li>%C - This will be replaced with the total number of photos in the album</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When making a custom tweet template for a album, make sure to keep in mind
            the 140 character limit, remembering that the token replacement will
            most likely make the message longer than it appears in the text box.
            SuprSetr will trim the final message to fit within 140 characters,
            truncating the message to fit.
