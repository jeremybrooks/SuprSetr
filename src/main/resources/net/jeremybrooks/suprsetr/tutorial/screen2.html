        <h1>The Main Window</h1>
        <p>The SuprSetr main window displays a list of your albums. Albums that
            SuprSetr manages will be listed first, followed by albums that are not
            managed, in alphabetic order. You can choose to hide the unmanaged
            albums by using the options in the View menu.</p>

        <h2>Toolbars</h2>

        <p>At the top of the main window you will find the toolbars. There is a
           toolbar that contains buttons for the edit functions and a filter box,
           and a toolbar that contains buttons for other tools.</p>

        <p>By default, the tools toolbar is hidden. You can show and hide toolbars
           by using the View -> Toolbars menu.</p>
