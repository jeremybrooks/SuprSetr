        <h1>The Main Window</h1>
        <p>The SuprSetr main window displays a list of your albums. Albums that
            SuprSetr manages will be listed first, followed by albums that are not
            managed, in alphabetic order. You can choose to hide the unmanaged
            albums by using the options in the View menu.</p>

        <p>At the top of the main window you will find the toolbar. The toolbar
            contains buttons to add, edit, delete, and refresh your albums. There
            is also a button to open the currently selected set in your browser. These
            options correspond to the options found in the Edit menu. In
            addition, there is a filter text box. If you enter text into the
            filter box, only albums that contain text in the title which matches
            the filter text will be displayed.</p>
