        <h1>Preferences</h1>
        <p>You can access the Preferences dialog box from the Edit menu
            (Windows and Linux), or from the SuprSetr application menu (Mac).
            You can control the behavior of tweets
            (automatically adding "via SuprSetr" if there is room), add "Managed by SuprSetr" to
            the end of album descriptions for managed albums, allow SuprSetr to check for
            updates at startup, control how long it should be before a album needs
            to be refreshed, and how many faves are needed for a fave tag to be
            added by FavrTagr.</p>

        <h2>Authorizations</h2>
        <p>You can deauthorize/reauthorize Flickr and Twitter here as well. Remember that
            if you deauthorize Flickr, SuprSetr will not be able to manage your albums.</p>

        <h2>Proxy</h2>
        <p>You can configure network proxy information here. If your proxy does not require
           authentication, just leave the username and password fields blank.</p>

        <h2>Auto Refresh</h2>
        <p>SuprSetr can automatically refresh your albums at a specified time. To enable this,
        just check the box and album the time you want your albums to be refreshed. SuprSetr will
        check the time periodically and start updating your albums when the time comes. Note that
        in order for this to work, SuprSetr must be running.</p>

    <p>If you do not want to leave SuprSetr running all the time, you can configure your
    operating system to launch SuprSetr a few minutes before the auto refresh time. Selecting
    the box that says "Exit SuprSetr after auto-refresh completes" will make SuprSetr exit
    after the refresh is complete.</p>
