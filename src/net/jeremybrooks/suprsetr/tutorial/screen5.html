        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <p>In the Tools menu, you will find some extra goodies that will help
           you manage your photosets in different ways.</p>

        <h2>FavrTagr</h2>
        <p>FavrTagr will look through all the photos in your Flickr stream,
            adding "fav" tags that indicate how many people have marked the
            photo as a favorite. You can specify the interval in the Preferences
            dialog. The default is 10, so for every 10 favorites on a photo, a
            tag will be added: fav10, fav20, fav30, etc. You can then create
            sets based on the tags. For example a set called Ten Faves, which
            includes all photos with the tag fav10.</p>
        <p>Since FavrTagr has to look at every photo in your photostream, it can
            take some time to run. It will provide feedback as it looks through
            your photos, telling you how many is has processed.</p>

        <h2>Set Ordering Tool</h2>
        <p>The Set Ordering Tool will present you a list of your photosets on
            Flickr, and allow you to reorder them. You can drag and drop them,
            or use the drop down to automatically order them based on their
            titles or the number of photos in the sets. If you want to make
            sure that certain sets appear first when people view your Flickr set
            page, this is the tool for you!</p>

        <h2>Compress Logs</h2>
        <p>If you are experiencing errors, you can use this tool to create a zip
            file containing the SuprSetr log files. These log files can then be
            emailed to <a href="mailto:suprsetr@jeremybrooks.net">suprsetr@jeremybrooks.net</a>,
            and the problem can be fixed.</p>
